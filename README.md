# FleetSyncAI

## Our Vision

FleetSyncAI was conceived with the ambitious goal of revolutionizing the Indian Transportation Sector. Our vision was to create a group of AI agents that would optimize the logistics system of India. While the full scope of this project was challenging to deliver within the given timeframe, we have made significant progress in developing the foundation and integrating with llama-agents.

## What We Aimed to Achieve

The core idea behind FleetSyncAI is to optimize the routes of transport trucks to maximize cargo transportation efficiency in a single journey. We aimed to achieve this by:

1. Providing information on the closest possible warehouse with available goods for transportation.
2. Reducing empty truck journeys.
3. Developing a system of AI agents to manage various aspects of the logistics process.

## Our Progress

We have focused on developing four key AI agents:

1. warehouseAgent
2. fleetAgent
3. bookingAgent
4. trackingAgent

These agents are designed to work together to streamline different aspects of the logistics operation, from inventory management to route optimization.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if you haven't already.
3. Ensure the Docker engine is running.
4. Run the following command in your terminal:
5. Navigate to the llama-agent integration directory:
6. Run the main application:
python main.py
or
python3 main.py

## Future Development

While we've made progress in developing the AI agents and integrating with llama-agents, there's still work to be done to fully realize our vision. We will complete our project and hope to reach out you guys back soon.
